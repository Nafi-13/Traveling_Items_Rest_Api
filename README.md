# Traveling_Items_Rest_Api

Created a comprehensive system for efficiently managing "Traveling Accessories" inventory for a shop.
Utilized modern web technologies, including Java Spring Boot and mySQL, to develop the system.
Implemented a robust RESTful API that enables the shop to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations seamlessly on their traveling accessories data.
Employed Postman for request verification and API testing, ensuring reliability and functionality.
